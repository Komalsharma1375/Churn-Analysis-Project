## ðŸŸ  Project Overview

Customer churn poses a significant challenge in the telecom industry, where retaining customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project provides a data-driven solution through in-depth churn analysis, predictive modeling, and interactive visualizations to support proactive retention strategies.

**Key Achievements:**
- Analyzed **6,418 customer records** with a **27% churn rate**
- Identified **378 high-risk customers** from **411 new joiners**
- Achieved **84% accuracy** in churn prediction
- Developed interactive dashboards for real-time insights
- Delivered recommendations to reduce customer attrition
